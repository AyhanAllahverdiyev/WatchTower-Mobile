# WatchTower - Shift Tracking System

## Overview
This project, developed within the scope of the Ankara University Computer Engineering graduation project, is a "Shift Tracking System." It has been created through collaborative efforts by [Ayhan Allahverdiyev](https://github.com/AyhanAllahverdiyev) and [Filiz Salnur](https://github.com/filizsalnur). The backend code repository can be found at [WatchTower-Backend](https://github.com/filizsalnur/WatchTower-Backend).

## Description
WatchTower is a comprehensive Shift Tracking System designed to streamline and enhance shift management using NFC technology. The system provides real-time tracking of security guards' activities, evaluates performance, records shift passage times, and allows quick communication through an emergency alarm button. Managers can add/update shift tracking points, and the system ensures effective user authorization management.

## Features
- NFC technology for easy updates and tracking.
- Real-time performance evaluation of security guards.
- Recording passage times at shift tracking points.
- Emergency alarm button for quick communication.
- User-friendly system with minimal installation.
- Web application for detailed analysis using machine learning.
